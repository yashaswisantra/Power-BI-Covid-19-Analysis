# Power-BI-Covid-19-Analysis

I have tried to do a small visualization on Impact of Covid 19. Here, I have discussed the total new deaths and total cumulative new deaths during Covid 19 for different countries, WHO regions and years.  I also added slicer to see the effect for any specific country, any specific year or month.

Here are the key insights from the COVID-19 dashboard:

1) Top Affected Countries: The United States has the highest number of new deaths, followed by Brazil, India, Russia and highest number of new cases, followed by India, Brazil, France, and the United Kingdom.
2) Temporal Trends: Deaths have increased each year from 2020 to 2022. The highest spike in daily new deaths (20K) occurred in early 2022. 2021 accounted for 66% of cumulative deaths, followed by 2022 (23%) and 2020 (11%).
Cases have increased each year from 2020 to 2022. The highest spike in daily new cases (4 million) occurred in early 2022. 2021 accounted for 62% of cumulative cases, followed by 2022 (31%) and 2020 (7%).
3) Seasonal Patterns: Multiple spikes in deaths and new cases are visible, suggesting potential waves or seasonal variations.
4) Regional Impact: The map shows widespread global impact, with varying intensities across regions and across WHO regions.
5) Cumulative Trend: Average cumulative deaths show a steady increase from January 2020 to January 2022, rising from near 0 to about 25,000.
Average cumulative cases show an exponential increase from January 2020 to January 2022, rising from near 0 to about 1.92 million.
6) Data Range: The dashboard covers data from March 1, 2020, to March 25, 2022
7) Reporting Patterns: Daily death reports and new cases fluctuate significantly, possibly due to reporting practices.
8) Year-over-Year Comparison: Each subsequent year shows a higher baseline of daily deaths and new cases compared to the previous year.
9) WHO Regions: The dashboard allows for analysis by WHO regions (AFRO, AMRO, EMRO, EURO, etc.), indicating a global perspective on the pandemic.
